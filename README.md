# Dusk of a Shattered Kingdom #

This is a traditional roguelike where you are being imprisoned at the bottom of a dungeon and need to escape. 
Note that you will need to go up stairs, which is the opposite of most roguelikes.

## Story ##

The Kingdom of Bador invaded Alumir in 1093.  The defenses of Alumir were betrayed by an order of its knights and the king
was slain.

You were a citizen loyal to the King of the Fallen Kingdom of Alumir and have been locked away.  You must escape the dungeon
to free your lands.


## My tools: ##

+ Groovy
+ SquidLib 1.95.1 ( https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib)
+ Gradle for building
+ Java
+ Intellij


## Download ##

## Run Prepackaged ##
Download the above zip, extract it.  Navigate to the directory and execute

```bash
java -jar dusk-1.0.jar
```

If it doesn't work, make sure you have Java 8 installed.  If you don't, you can grab it from http://www.java.com/

## Compile From Source ##
To compile from source you will need a JDK and to install groovy and gradle.  I recommend using http://gvmtool.net/ for that.
Once you are set up, it will be something like:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/stewsters/dusk.git

cd dusk

gradle run
```


## Controls ##
I tried to use Brogue as a model for my UI, so controls are similar.

```
Movement: numpad, vi keys, or arrow keys (if you don't like diagonal movement)

Melee: Bump into enemies

a: apply

d: drop

i: view inventory

g: Pick up

e: equip

r: remove

esc: back out of menus.  If you are not in a menu, it will bring up one that lets you level up your character or exit to main.

```
